<<<<<<< Updated upstream
We are going to build a web-app about crowdfunding for gifts. When a user posts his/her wish list, like birthday or wedding wish, on our web-app, his/her friends can see it and partially fund the gift.
So far, we have finished writing the register function, the log-in function and the basic interface. We are going to add more front end applications to our project to make it user-friendly.

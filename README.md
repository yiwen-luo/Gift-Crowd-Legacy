###Updated
The project is re-write in Python, which can be found in [this repository] (https://github.com/caoy11/GiftCrowd).

###Legacy

We are going to build a web-app about crowdfunding for gifts. When a user posts his/her wish list, like birthday or wedding wish, on our web-app, his/her friends can see it and partially fund the gift.

So far, we have finished writing the register function, the log-in function and the basic interface. Also, the friends list and add/remove friends function are done. The wish posting function and the funding function are under construction.
